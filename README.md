> Snake, but in LOVE2D

There's not much else to say. It's the classic game Snake, but written in [LOVE2D](https://love2d.org), a free Lua game engine. Neat, right?

Controls with arrow keys. Press Enter to restart if you lose. Red boxes are food; collect them to grow bigger! The green boxes are you, the lighter green one being your head.

This game uses [Hack](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/), a beautiful typeface for source code (and apparently game UI). Major props to the Hack creators; check 'em out if you're looking for a new font for your IDE!
